This is a public repository for my source code of my encryption software that encrypts/decrypts files using the AES (Advance Encryption Standard). It took me about 5 months to make it and I had a lot of fun along the way. During the process, I learned a lot about computer safety and encryption. Python is the only coding language used in the software as it is the language that I code the most in. This was originally made about 6-7 months ago and I recently uploaded it here. I will be making a second version of this software that improves on the design, and functionality, which I am working on right now. The second version might have some code available in /v2 but that might not be for a while.
